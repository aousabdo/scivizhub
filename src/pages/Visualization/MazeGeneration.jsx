                  These mazes form a spanning tree where each cell is a node and passages are edges.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-3">Evaluating Maze Complexity</h3>
            <p>
              Several metrics can be used to evaluate the complexity and difficulty of generated mazes:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-3">
              <li><strong>Solution Length:</strong> Distance from start to end along the correct path</li>
              <li><strong>Dead End Count:</strong> Number of passages that terminate without connecting to others</li>
              <li><strong>Branching Factor:</strong> Average number of choices at each junction</li>
              <li><strong>River Factor:</strong> Tendency of passages to continue straight rather than turn</li>
              <li><strong>Braid Ratio:</strong> Percentage of dead ends converted to loops</li>
              <li><strong>Deepest Point:</strong> Cell with the maximum distance from the entrance</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Different algorithms create mazes with different profiles across these metrics. For example,
              Recursive Backtracking tends to create mazes with long solution paths and many dead ends,
              while Recursive Division creates more structured mazes with long, straight corridors.

              Mazes have fascinated humans across cultures and throughout history:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-3">
              <li><strong>Ancient Origins:</strong> The earliest known mazes date back over 4,000 years to Ancient Egypt and Crete</li>
              <li><strong>Classical Mythology:</strong> The Labyrinth of King Minos and the Minotaur is perhaps the most famous maze in literature</li>
              <li><strong>Garden Mazes:</strong> Hedge mazes became popular in European gardens during the Renaissance</li>
              <li><strong>Modern Applications:</strong> From puzzles to psychology experiments to computer algorithms</li>
              <li><strong>Computational Complexity:</strong> Maze solving algorithms are studied in computer science for path-finding and optimization</li>

              "A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from an entrance to a goal."
              â€” The earliest printed maze appeared in 1577 in a book by Italian Renaissance architect Giovanni Battista Belici.

          <p>
            While this visualization focuses on 2D orthogonal grid mazes, many variations exist:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-3">
            <li><strong>3D Mazes:</strong> Extend into three dimensions with passages that go up and down</li>
            <li><strong>Weave Mazes:</strong> Allow passages to cross over or under each other</li>
            <li><strong>Circular Mazes:</strong> Built on concentric circles rather than a grid</li>
            <li><strong>Hex Mazes:</strong> Based on hexagonal cells rather than squares</li>
            <li><strong>Triangular Mazes:</strong> Use triangular cells for a different geometric experience</li>
            <li><strong>Fractal Mazes:</strong> Self-similar patterns that repeat at different scales</li>
            <li><strong>Logic Mazes:</strong> Incorporate rules or constraints beyond simple wall navigation</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            The algorithms demonstrated here can often be adapted to these different maze types by changing
            the underlying cell structure and connectivity rules.
